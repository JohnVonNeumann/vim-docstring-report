# vim-docstring-report

## Find all (currently Python) function declarations and ascertain whether they have docstrings written.

A tiny Vim plugin that allows users to scan through Python files and reports on
whether or not the `Def` declarations have docstrings written for them. This is a
plugin to assist with code quality.

### TODO's
* Add the ability to scan a directory.
* Add more languages.
* Provide better quality/verbose output.
