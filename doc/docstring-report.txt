INTRODUCTION                            *docstring-report*

Functions/Methods without docstrings often may not tell the whole story, this
Plugin helps programmers find functions without docs so they can fix them.

MAPPINGS                                *docstring-report-mappings*

Mappings work in all modes that the Author knows of, however, I am not a pro
Vimscript author, so I could be wrong.

<leader>f               Search the current file, and report back line numbers
                        without docstrings.

ABOUT                                   *docstring-report-about*
